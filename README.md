# JSDT

JSDT stands for Jack and Steven Data Transfer. This project was submitted as the final for a networking class at
Michigan State University. The end goal of the project was to demonstrate reliable data transfer over UDP. When built, this 
software provides two binaries, a server and a client. The client can request a file from the server and receive it over UDP. The 
software simulates packet loss by occasionally dropping UDP segments.

The code is a bit messy, as we and certainly not either of out best work. But nevertheless, I'm proud we got it to work at all.
